Here's how we can structure the backend infrastructure

### 1. **Database Schema Design:**

We'll design the database schema in MongoDB to accommodate both shared exercises and user-specific routines. Hereâ€™s a proposed structure:

- **Users Collection**:

  - `_id`: Unique identifier for each user.
  - `email`: User's email.
  - `password`: Hashed password.
  - `routines`: Array of user-specific routines.

- **Exercises Collection (Shared)**:

  - `_id`: Unique identifier for each exercise.
  - `name`: Name of the exercise.
  - `description`: Brief description of the exercise.
  - `gifUrl`: URL to the exercise GIF.
  - `defaultSets`: Default number of sets (optional).
  - `defaultReps`: Default number of repetitions (optional).

- **Routines Collection (User-Specific)**:

  - `_id`: Unique identifier for each routine.
  - `userId`: Reference to the user who created this routine.
  - `name`: Name of the routine.
  - `exercises`: Array of exercises in this routine.
    - Each exercise will be an object containing:
      - `exerciseId`: Reference to the exercise in the shared collection.
      - `name`: Name of the exercise.
      - `sets`: Number of sets.
      - `reps`: Number of reps.
      - `weight`: Weight used.

- **Training History Collection**:
  - `_id`: Unique identifier for each training session.
  - `userId`: Reference to the user.
  - `date`: Date of the workout session.
  - `exercises`: Array of exercises performed during this session.
    - Each exercise will have:
      - `exerciseId`: Reference to the exercise in the shared collection.
      - `name`: Name of the exercise.
      - `sets`: Number of sets performed.
      - `reps`: Number of reps performed.
      - `weight`: Weight used.

### 2. **API Endpoints:**

To interact with this structure, you can set up the following API endpoints:

- **User Authentication**:

  - `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /api/auth/login`: Log in a user and generate a JWT.

- **Exercise Management**:

  - `GET /api/exercises`: Fetch all exercises from the shared collection.
  - `GET /api/exercises/:id`: Fetch details of a specific exercise by its ID.

- **Routine Management**:

  - `POST /api/routines`: Create a new routine for a user.
  - `GET /api/routines`: Get all routines for a user.
  - `GET /api/routines/:id`: Get a specific routine by ID.
  - `PUT /api/routines/:id`: Update a specific routine.
  - `DELETE /api/routines/:id`: Delete a routine.

- **Training History**:
  - `POST /api/history`: Record a completed workout session.
  - `GET /api/history`: Fetch all training sessions for a user.
  - `GET /api/history/:id`: Get details of a specific training session.

### 3. **Additional Considerations:**

- **Authentication Middleware**: Implement JWT-based authentication middleware to protect routes and ensure that users can only access their own data.

- **Data Validation**: Use a library like `Joi` or `express-validator` to validate the incoming data to ensure it meets the expected schema.

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage different scenarios like invalid data, unauthorized access, or server errors.

- **Scalability**: Even though scalability isn't a concern yet, structuring the API and database in a modular way will make it easier to scale in the future as user numbers grow.
